# Unplug-Charger-Android-App

Unplug Charger is an android application for the smartphones. This application helps in maintaining battery as wells as phone's health. As people put their phone on charging over the whole night and forget which results in phone overcharging, heating, battery issue etc. This application saves user's phone and battery from degrading.It is always necessary to unplug user's charger when the phone is charged full so that the risk of overheating and overcharging can be avoided. In case user forgets to unplug, this application will remind user to unplug user's charger.

Also this application calculates the remaining time to charge the phone so that user can remember and also can have an idea that user needs to unplug user's charger after plugin user's phone.This application is easy to use and understand by user of any age group. This application is for each and every person who is having smartphones. The unplug charger helps them by protecting their phone and battery so that their smartphone can have more life than usually.However the technology has many advancement, more and more research is going on in order to make our phone more safe and protected .Now a days phones have a circuit mechanism to cut off the connection of main supply with the battery when it gets fully charged.So, this means once user sees the battery level on user's smartphone at 100 percent then it is no longer on the main power supply or in other words user smartphone is back on its battery strength. But there is a flaw and this technology does not solve our issue and problem as it is fine that the circuits cuts off the battery from the main supply when it reaches 100% but then it gets back to the power supply when it reaches 99%. So, this cycle of hopping between 99% and 100% creates a problem for user's smartphone. 

Generally it is not 99% percent for all the smartphones, few smartphones will plug user's battery into the power supply once it reaches 90% and this figure varies as per different devices but the difference in these figures are not huge. This process of frequent and continuous charging and discharging causes user's smartphone to heat-up and thus hampering the strength of the battery of user's smartphone.Another point which can be noted that when user's battery is between the level of 90% and 100%, then it produces a corrosive effect which further hampers the battery health.

The major feature of this application is its alerting feature; it alerts the user when the phone is charged fully. Using this application the battery can be saved from degrading due to overheating, overcharging and unnecessary power supply, thus increasing the battery life. The alert tone can easily be changed and set according to the user’s choice. This application also the estimation the exact time remaining to charge the battery to its full capacity.

There are multiple features in this android application which includes the representation of information of various smartphone’s hardware including battery, Central processing Unit , storage devices (Internal storage and external storage if any present) and Random Access memory. Use can view these details of each hardware in an individual devoted tab in the application.
